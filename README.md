# Welcome to the GitHub for the NEEMSIS longitudinal survey!

:wrench: *Network, Employment, dEbt, Mobility, and Skills in South India Survey* (NEEMSIS), is a longitudinal data collection tool that aims at understanding the links between labour, skills, financial practices, social and migration dynamics and social networks formation in India through individual and household surveys.

:office: The overall aim of this GitHub is to provide a platform for sharing the code needed to build and clean up the NEEMSIS databases and to construct relevant variables (assets, debt, etc.).

:large_orange_diamond: Feel free to visit the NEEMSIS website and use the data available on dataverse.
