# Welcome to the GitHub of the NEEMSIS survey!

:wrench: NEEMSIS is a longitudinal data collection tool that aims at understanding the links between labour, skills, financial practices, social and migration dynamics and social networks formation in India through individual and household surveys.

:office: The aim of this GitHub is to provide a platform for sharing the code needed to build and clean up the NEEMSIS databases and to construct relevant variables (assets, debt, cognition, etc.).

* The [`Articles`](https://github.com/neemsis/Articles) folder contains codes relating to published articles that use NEEMSIS datasets.
* The [`NEEMSIS-2`](https://github.com/neemsis/NEEMSIS-2) folder contains codes relating to the NEEMSIS-2 (2020-21) wave.
* The [`NEEMSIS-1`](https://github.com/neemsis/NEEMSIS-1) folder contains codes relating to the NEEMSIS-1 (2016-17) wave.
* The [`RUME`](https://github.com/neemsis/RUME) folder contains codes relating to the RUME (2010) baseline survey.
